# Overview

By now you should have completed, or be close to wrapping up, Code.Org Unit 5: Building Apps. Unit 5 extends unit 3 to provide a foundation for building "real" apps that do small but useful tasks and which you can share with others. This is the basis of the Create Task.

You can find the slides from today's Zoom session [here][slides].
