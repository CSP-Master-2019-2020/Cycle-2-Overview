# Overview

By now you should have completed, or be close to wrapping up, Code.Org Unit 5: Building Apps. Unit 5 extends unit 3 to provide a foundation for building "real" apps that do small but useful tasks and which you can share with others. This is the basis of the Create Task.

Next up is the [Create Performance Task][ct]. To complete the Create Performance Task you will:
* Design & implement a small application using [App Lab][applab].
* Make a short demo video for your app.
* Complete the written responses about your app.

The deadline for completing all three components and uploading them to your [Digital Portfolio][dp] is **8:59 PM on Tuesday the 26th of May.**

You can find the slides from today's Zoom session [here][slides].
